# Hi there 👌

## About Me

I'm 18 years old and from Germany. In my free time, I'm really into gaming and coding.
I enjoy exploring different areas of programming – whether it's frontend, backend, UI design, software, or even hardware.
Besides spending time in front of a screen,
I also like hanging out with friends and going out to parties. That balance between tech and social life is\ important to me.

I'm a strong team player and enjoy working with others. While I sometimes find it hard to stay focused on tasks that don't interest me,
I'm fully motivated and concentrated when it comes to topics and projects I'm passionate about.
